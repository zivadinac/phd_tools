# Helper scripts for setting up Docker.

## Todo:
    * Install docker using install scripts

    * Create an account on [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/) (used for base images)

    * `sudo docker login` - to log into your account

Doing this will make using docker easy for other tools that rely on it.
