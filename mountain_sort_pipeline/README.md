# Spike sorting pipeline based on mountain sort and adapted to JC data formats
This pipeline includes mountainsort4 for automatic spike sorting (adapted from [Igor Gridchyn's](https://github.com/igridchyn) version) and spikeinterface + phy for manual curation of the results.

## Installation
Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
Create conda virtual environment for mountainsort4:

```
conda env create -f ms_clust.yml
```
   
Create conda virtual environment for spike interface and phy:

```
conda env create -f si_phy.yml
```

## Usage
To run the mountainsort4 you should use provided script [run_ms_local](mountainsort_scripts/run_ms_local).
But before running it you should prepare a few files and put them into directory with your data:

##### geom.csv
Specifies tetrode geometry - usually the same in all cases (for tetrode recording) and should just be copied from here.

##### TEMPLATE.par
Text file in the following format:

```
channel_nu  num_bits (per datum, 16 for ushort in JC data)
sampling_interval (im microseconds) egg_sampling_interval (in microseconds)
num_of_working_tetrodes reference_channel
for working tetrode:
num_working_channels channels... i.e:
4 0 1 2 3 # fist tetrode with all working channels
2 5 7 # second tetrode with two working channels (5 and 7)
```

See TEMPLATE.par in this folder as an example.

##### BASELIST
Put names without extension (.dat) of all input files that you wish to be processed.
You can use [create_baselist](../bin/create_baselist) script if you wish all your files to be processed together.
    
### Running mountainsort4
Now you should be able to start mountainsort4 (from [mountainsort_scripts](./mountainsort_scripts/) directory):

```
conda activate ms_clust
./run_ms_local INPUT_DIR ANIMAL DAY THRESHOLD NUM_CHANNEL
```

Your sorted data will be in `INPUT_DIR/sorted/` directory.
This directory has results for each tetrode in a separate subdirectory (tet0, tet1...)

### Using phy for manual curation
To manually curate results you should run phy: 

```
conda activate si_phy
python axona_ms_to_phy.py --sampling_rate SAMPLING_RATE INPUT_DIR/sorted/
```

After this each tetrode will have a phy_export directory in it.
You should run phy from there, e.g:
    
```
cd INPUT_DIR/sorted/tet0/phy_export
phy template-gui params.py
```
